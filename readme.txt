1b. create a database in MySql
2.  follow the instructions for the install
2a. if you are upgrading, select UPGRADE and load the xml file there.

3.  once the install is complete, delete controllers/install_controller.php and /ipeer_export directory.

please note:

1. The database config file /app/config/database.php must be writable during installation. 
2. After installation, please make database.php read only. It is VERY important.
3. To change file permission, you may either use a FTP client or do it directly through command line (if you have
shell access to your server. In unix, you may use chmod command to do it)

please report any bugs you find on sourceforge. we can't fix it if we don't know about it.

any suggestion or question? please let us know

troubleshooting:

-if you type http://yourserverpath/youripeerpath/ and you get http://yourserverpath/loginout/login, your mod_rewrite
is not set up properly. make sure the line in http.conf has 'AllowOverride All'.
